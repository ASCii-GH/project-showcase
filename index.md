# Apratim Singh Chauhan - Project Showcase

## About

Hi, I’m Apratim! I have a background in Physics and am currently pursuing my M.Tech. degree in Applied Optics. My solid foundation in physics, coupled with my current focus on optical systems engineering, enables me to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical, real-world applications.

Throughout my studies, I have honed my skills in analysing, designing, and developing complex systems that integrate optics and electronics. Additionally, I have gained practical experience in metrology, various fabrication techniques, and an array of engineering tools.

In my spare time, I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and broadening my knowledge. Whether collaborating with others or working independently, I am driven by the thrill of tackling challenging engineering problems and discovering new insights along the way.
